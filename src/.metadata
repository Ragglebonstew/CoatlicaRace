  "description" : "Hailing from the depths of desert and scorched planets, the Coatlica rarely interact with the rest of the universe. Their size makes it difficult to maneuver the colonies of other species, but easy to navigate the ruins of species past. Many of the Coatlica find interest in forgotten history and mysticism. Older Coatlica are rumored to have access to special abilities, such as transforming into a giant snake!\n\nThis is a relatively small mod, with most of the content being focused in the Limbless Statue in your ship's locker. Select any ability to unlock the Snake Body tech, and activate it at any tech station. The tech also allows you to hold shift to better control your body.",
